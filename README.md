# A-Simulation-Platform-for-Truck-Platooning
This repository is to release a simulation platform for truck platooning evaluation in an interactive traffic environment. 
This repo contains: 
1) A user guide;
2) Truck platooning model;
3) Two simulation demos;
4) Two simulation videos of the above demos.



## Getting started
1) Read the user guide to know how to start the truck platooning simulation;
2) Watch the simulation videos to gain a preliminary understanding of our simulation platform;
3) Run the demos for a hands-on experience.

## Demo 1: Single-platoon lane-changing with background traffic
Demo 1 shows the lane-changing behavior of the truck platoon and its interaction with background traffic.

## Demo 2: Multiple-platoon cruising with background traffic
Demo 2 shows the platoon maneuvers, such as formation and splitting, within mixed traffic scenario.
