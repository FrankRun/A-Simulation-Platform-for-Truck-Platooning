# A-Simulation-Platform-for-Truck-Platooning
This repository is to release a simulation platform for truck platooning evaluation in an interactive traffic environment. 
This repo contains: 
1) A user guide;
2) Truck platooning model;
3) Two simulation demos;
4) Two simulation videos of the above demos.



## Getting started
1) Read the user guide to know how to start the truck platooning simulation;
2) Watch the simulation videos to gain a preliminary understanding of our simulation platform;
3) Run the demos for a hands-on experience.
