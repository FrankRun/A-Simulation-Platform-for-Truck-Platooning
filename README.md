# A-Simulation-Platform-for-Truck-Platooning
This repository is to release a simulation platform for truck platooning evaluation in an interactive traffic environment. 
This repo contains: 
1) a user guide;
2) truck platooning model;
3ï¼‰two simulation demos;
4) two simulation videos of the above demos.


## Getting started
1) Read the user guide to know how to start the truck platoonging simulation;
2) Watch the simulation videos to gain a preliminary understanding of our simulation platform;
3) Run the demos for a hands-on experience.
